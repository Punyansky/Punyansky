My name is Dmitry Punyansky and I’m a Data Analyst.
For the last 12 years, I have been working as a Technical Support Representative, Customer Orders Shift Leader and as Storekeeper. During this works, I understood that I like to keep everything in order and ensure that things are done just in the right way. I logically learned prioritize assigned tasks based on analysis of the current situation, time conditions, and amount of work. 
Recently I participated in the Practicum100 program by Yandex because I am inspired by the world of data, and I want to implement my skills in this field. During the program, I trained my analytical skills and gained the necessary technical skills to be able to fulfill my desire. I am excited to learn more and dig deeper in this field. Would be glad to get an opportunity to present myself personally.
